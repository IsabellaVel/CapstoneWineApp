# WineApp
Android Developer NanoDegree Capstone Project about idea of my choice. I have prepared an app that shows details of any wine of the world.

The app allows sharing functionality, as well as ordering via email and Google sign-on. I have used Room with ViewModel and LiveData; there is a widget and I have used also the libraries Picasso and Butterknife.

# Contribution
